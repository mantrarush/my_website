== README

To have this running, I have done the following:
 > Have the final version intended for deployment on master branch of its respective git repo
 > bundle install, bundle update, git add . , git commit -am "xyz" 
 > Create heroku remote  
 > git push heroku master
 > Go to Domain settings of the heroku remote app created, set the domain name to the one I have. 
 > Have the DNS target of the Heroku app, and have your domain name point to it (i.e. CNAME record) 
 
Woooo!
